Describe the derived products that worth saving.

* depths in r, u, z bands:

   reading off of depth-\*-[ruz].fits.gz for object
   in tractor-edr. 

   It takes a few minitues for the 3 million objects in tractor-edr.fits

   In the future, the catalogue comes in tractor directory
   as one file per brick. We need a smarter way of handling 
   this.

* sky brightness:

   Where shall this come from?
   is this also in bricks?

* extinction:
   
   extinction in r, u, z (and maybe more) as a function of RA DEC;
   is this also in bricks?
