1. First modify and run jobs 

1.1 For randoms

make_rans.job

1.2. For targets (add types and --extra-target-definitions if you want)

select_objs.job

2. Next, run

postprocess.sh 

to finish it. 

3. Tricks:

3.1 To see a list of targets run 

imglss-export-text.py --help

3.2 I usually symlink photodesi/scripts/targets to this directory 
    and set extra-target-definitions to targets/
