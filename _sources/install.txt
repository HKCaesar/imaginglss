Installation
============

ImagingLSS is supposed to be used without installation.

However, some basic packages need to be set up before using the scripts

Depencency
----------

ImagingLSS is light on dependency.
It depends only on fitsio or astropy:

.. code-block:: bash

    easy_install --user fitsio
    #easy_install --user astropy

On some Edison,

.. code-block:: bash

    module load fitsio

File Paths
----------
 
ImagingLSS core libary and the tools scripts defaults to use :code:`DECALS_IMAGING` as the root path of the data release.

In addition, :code:`DECALS_CACHE` must be set to a directory with large free storage space, for caching the catalogue data.

.. code-block:: bash

    export DECALS_IMAGING=/global/project/projectdirs/cosmo/work/decam/release/edr/
    export DECALS_CACHE=$GSCRATCH/desicache
 
Getting Started
---------------

.. code-block:: bash

    from model.datarelease import DataRelease
    dr = DataRelease()

Also refer to the :doc:`examples` of the documentation.
