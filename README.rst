This is a data model of the DECAM imaging survey data 
and potentially also for other desi targeting imaging survey, 
for Large scale structure analysis.

The modelled data is a product from the Tractor, the source identification
software used in by DESI.

We have support on the `Early Data Release (EDR) data <https://desi.lbl.gov/trac/wiki/DecamLegacy/EDRfiles>`_
and `DR1 <https://desi.lbl.gov/trac/wiki/DecamLegacy/DR1>`_ .
